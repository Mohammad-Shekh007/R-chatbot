## Overview

This R-based chatbot allows you to chat with a sarcastic, witty version of **Tony Stark (Assistant)**, inspired by Iron Man. It uses the **OpenAI API** to generate responses based on your input, and the chatbot adopts Tony Stark’s personality, providing fun and humorous replies. The chatbot responds in real-time through the R console, and your conversation is saved, allowing you to pick up right where you left off without losing previous messages.

The chatbot also formats the responses by breaking them into 20-word segments for improved readability, making it easier to follow along. All you need to do is paste your API key into the provided section of the code and run it.
